I want you to help me build a simple 2D web game using Phaser.js that helps users learn Latin, Greek, Old English and Germanic  root and stem  words.  The game is for middle school students to learn stem and root words. The game should: 

Quiz the user on the meaning of a root word (e.g., "What does 'ante' mean?"). 

If the user answers incorrectly, show one or two example words that use the root (e.g., "antedate", "antebellum") as a hint. 

Keep track of the score for correct answers. 

Play sound effects to indicate correct (ding) or incorrect (buzz) answers. 

Please: 

Use Phaser 3 (latest stable version). 

Use the reorganized_stem_words.json as the data source for the words game.  

There are 20 list and each list has 25 words. 

Game should support 2 modes: random words from all lists or allow user learn and master words by each list. 

 Allow multiple choice answers (e.g., 4 choices) and highlight the correct one after user answers. 

After user answers, show the example words their meanings to reinforce learning  

Link the example words to search link.  

Use minimalistic background with muted textures, soft gradients or simple patterns.  

Play sounds for correct/wrong answers
